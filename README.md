# Cardify
## Description
Cardify allows users to create virtual business cards, which displays users' name, occupation, a short summary about themselves, email, phone number, and social media links. The project was developed over a span of 32 hours, with very minimal rest and sleep.

Cardify is a full MERN stack:
- MongoDB
- Express.js

- JWT authentication
- RESTful APIs
- Full CRUD operations
- Google's GeminiAI
- Basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript for FrontEnd
- Deployment on Heroku
- Version control with Git/Github

## Planning materials
There were not that many planning materials used in the development in this project except for Figma for wireframing, as well as extensive discussion with team members about how and what to plan.

## Key Features
- User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account and log in using JWT authentication.
- Full CRUD Operations: Users can create their own business cards, read however many they have made, update them individually, or delete them as they please.
- GeminiAI: GeminiAI is used to create a one-sentence prompt for an individual user, similar to a personal-brand statement.
